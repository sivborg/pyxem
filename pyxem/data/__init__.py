"""Example datasets for use when testing functionality.

Some datasets are packaged with the source code while others must be downloaded from the web.
For more test datasets, see Open datasets.

Datasets are placed in a local cache, in the location returned from pooch.os_cache("pyxem") by default.
the location can be overwritten with a global PYXEM_DATA_DIR environment variable.

With every new version of pyxem, a new directory of datasets with the version name
is added to the cache directory. Any old directories are not deleted automatically, and should
then be deleted manually if desired.
